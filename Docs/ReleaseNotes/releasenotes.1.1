Amrvis version 1.1 release notes.

The major changes for this release are better support for deep (many
level) data sets and level menu functionality that comes closer
to how I feel it should work.  Other changes include consolidation
of some defaults and command line settings and a few bug fixes.
Details follow.

In amrvis 1.0, subregions were restricted to a multiple of a coarse
level cell.  This became a problem in 3D because even a single coarse
cell expanded to the finest level was very large for deep data
sets.  In amrvis 1.1, subregions are restricted to what I term
the finestContainingLevel, which is the finest level that has
grids which completely contain the subregion (the complement is null).
The level menu for a subregion will show only levels in the range
[finestContainingLevel, maxAllowableLevel].  The maxAllowableLevel
is the maximum level which can be displayed based on the
maxpixmap size.  Volume rendering is done on maxAllowableLevel.
FArrayBox output is done on the current displayed level (the value
in the level menu).  Animations work on the currenly displayed level.
The dataset also works at maxAllowableLevel, where the smallest boxes
containing data are at maxAllowableLevel.

The file type (cgmf, sf, etc.) can now be set in amrvis.defaults
with the keyword filetype (for example,  filetype sf).  Valid
values are the same as the command line values without the dash
(cgmf, cgsf, mf, sf, old2, iamr, cgiamr, boxdata, boxchar, fab).

Byte ordering can be specified on the command line with one of
the following:  -sgi, -alpha, or -reverse2  (same values as in
amrvis.defaults, but with dashes).

Command line settings override amrvis.defaults settings.

A more visible message is printed out by amrvis to show which
byte ordering and filetype are used.

I have versions of amrvis 1.1 on the C90 (a.nersc) and the J90 (k.nersc).
See me if you need them.  Also, I can compile special versions for
HDF support, volume rendering using a value model instead of a lighting
model, and volume rendering with grids in the flow.

Bug fixes:
  The problem with a constant field in the dataset is fixed.

  The problem of the highest data value in the palette window
  sometimes not matching the highest data value in the dataset
  is fixed.  This was a roundoff issue in the Palette display.

  The problem of occasional misaligned grids for 2d datasets is fixed.
